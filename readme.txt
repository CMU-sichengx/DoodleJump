The name for the project is "Doodle Jump Modified". It is a rebuilding of the classical game doodle jump. Press left or right arrow to move horizontally, and click mouse to shoot.

To run it, just run the "tp3.py" file in the TP3_Codebase folder. If you want to renew your highest score record, just delete the contents in the "highestScore.txt" and type "0" into that  text file.

The program doesn't use extra modules or packages. It only uses cmu_112_graphics, which is included in the folder.

There is no keyboard shortcuts.
